# Syllable Checker

This java program checks the number of syllables in a given word, according to this rule - 

>Each contiguous sequence of one or more vowels is a syllable, with the following exception: a lone "e" at the end of a word is not considered a syllable unless the word has no other syllables. You should consider y a vowel.


Examples - 

> Under the rules for what defines a syllable, the words “the”, “fly”, “yes”, “cave” and “double” all
have 1 syllable, but "segue" has two syllables. Notice that this isn’t exactly correct (“double”
actually has 2 syllables), but it’s close enough for our purposes. Here are some more examples
with the number of syllables your method should return to help you: "contiguous" (3 syllables),
"sleepy" (2 syllables), "obvious" (2 syllables), "toga" (2 syllables). Notice that our rules get a lot
wrong, especially when you have more than 2 vowels in a row, but these are the rules we will
test you against.
