A simple Hangman-ish game, written in objected oriented Java.


--------Game Features--------------
1. User gets 7 attempts to get the right word.
2.  All possible words to-guess are stored in a (static) array. Everytime a game runs, a word is picked from it randomly.
3. Bad input is not counted from the available 7 guesses (see validation below).
4. If user wins, a message shows how many attempts they won with.
5. If user loses, a message shows what the word was.

---------Validation Features ----------
1. A repeat guess is not counted as a valid attempt(from the available 7). Game asks for a guess again.
2. Only alphabets are accepted. Numericals and other illegal characters are discarded, and are not counted as a valid attempt. Game asks for a guess again.
3. Capitalization is taken care of.

Enjoy the game!
